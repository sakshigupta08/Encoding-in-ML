# Encoding-in-ML
In machine learning, we usually deal with datasets which contains multiple labels in one or more than one columns. These labels can be in the form of words or numbers. To make the data understandable or in human readable form, the training data is often labeled in words. Encoding is a required pre-processing step when working with categorical data for machine learning algorithms.
